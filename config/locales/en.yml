  information_title: "Have you ever wondered what it would be like to talk to the city that you live in?"
  information_text: "Around the world, cities have been waking up and talking to their residents (Japan, Singapore, UK, France and the USA). Now the neighbourhoods of Astana are coming to life and they want to learn everything there is to know about themselves. Where is everyone rushing off to in the mornings? Where are the best places to meet friends and hang out? What was here before? What are everyone’s dreams for the future?"
  infomation_text_2: "From the 10th of August until the 31st, you will be able to talk to your local neighbourhood (and all the others around the city) and also learn what your neighbours also have to say."

  more_information: "More Information"
  more_information_text_1: "Though most of the time they go unnoticed, across the city there are thousands of sign posts hovering above our heads. Hello Astana invites you to see your home in a new way, by giving a new meaning and usage to these signs."
  more_information_text_2: "We are hijacking/commandeering the signs of Astana and using them in a unique way. In the same way that hashtags (#) work in social media, we can use the street names and numbers of each neighbourhood to focus conversations on a particular theme - in this case, very specific locations."
  more_information_text_3: "You can share with everyone else the things that you like, what you care about, your opinions, your memories of the past and your ambitions for the future. You can then learn what your nearest neighbours think and care about too. Maybe you’ll learn something about your home you never knew before! Maybe you will see it forever changed in some new way!"
  more_information_text_4: "The interaction takes the form of a conversation. The neighbourhoods have woken up for the first time and they are curious about the world around them. They have a lot of questions and they need you to help answer them. Some neighbourhoods have figured out a little bit about themselves already and will have questions on specific themes - see if you can hunt these places down!"
